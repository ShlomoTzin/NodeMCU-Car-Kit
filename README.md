# NodeMCU-Car-Kit
NodeMCU lua code for car kit 2wd

This code uses the  smartphone's accelerometer (x) to determine the direction you what the car to go.

This is code for any ESP8266 version (I used D1 mini / wemos)
The microcontroller must run NodeMCU firmware (Get a NodeMCU flasher for that) 
rename the file to 'init.lua' so it runs automatically after power
I used RoboRemo App to control the car.  I used their code to begin with and rewrote it all except the connection part.

I hope you find this usefull
